  <p class="index2p1">
    Full grown Red Pandas are about 20-25 inches (about 60 cm) long without their tails, or 35-40 inches (97 cm) including them. They weigh about 19 pounds or 55 kilograms. They are about the size of a big cat. 
    Red Pandas are good climbers and they eat bamboo only. While they look a lot like racoons they are actually not even close to family from them.  And tehy are also not family from the giant white-black pandas! Rather, 
    Red pandas are family of bears. They live about 12-15 years. Red Pandas are endangered because the forests they live in get cut down for wood. Also, hunters pouch them for their fur, teeth and so-told medical powers,
    and people keep them as pets. If you want to know more about how Red Pandas are protected, click on the button above that says: 'Red Panda Network' or click <a href="index3.html.">here</a>.
    Red Pandas live solitary, except in breeding season, wich goes from january until march. they are able to reproduce after 18 months and they get one to four cups per season but both males and females may mate with more than
    one partner each season. And they do not stay together after breeding.

    While Red Pandas live mostly in trees and on mountains in China, they breed and eat on the ground, also, they are actually excellent swimmers and can cross rivers easily. also, while Red Pandas are mostly built like cats and
    racoons, they have six fingers at every paw to help with cimbing big trees.
